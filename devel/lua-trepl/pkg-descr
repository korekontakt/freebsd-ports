A pure Lua REPL with heavy support for Torch types. Uses Readline for
tab completion.

This package installs a new binary named `th`, which
comes packed with all these features:

  * Tab-completion on nested namespaces
  * Tab-completion on disk files (when opening a string)
  * History
  * Pretty print (table introspection and coloring)
  * Auto-print after eval (can be stopped with ;)
  * Each command is profiled, timing is reported
  * No need for '=' to print
  * Easy help with: `? funcname`
  * Self help: `?`
  * Shell commands with: $ cmd (example: `$ ls`)
  * Print all user globals with `who()`
  * Import a package's symbols globally with `import(package)`
  * Require is overloaded to provide relative search paths:
   `require('./mylocallib/')`
  * Optional strict global namespace monitoring
  * Optional async REPL
